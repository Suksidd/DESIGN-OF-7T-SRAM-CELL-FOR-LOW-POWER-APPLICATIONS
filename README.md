# DESIGN-OF-7T-SRAM-CELL-FOR-LOW-POWER-APPLICATIONS
Low power consumption is critical for VLSI system design as memory technology on Systems-on-Chip (SoC) shrinks and small devices and embedded systems emerge. More than 70% of the Soc is taken up by static random-access memory (SRAM). 

A standard 6T SRAM cell has two-bit lines for reading and writing operation; thus, it consumes more power. There are many techniques for power reduction like scaling of the supply voltage (Vo) and threshold voltage (Vt), multi- Vo, multi- Vt etc. The voltage scaling harms the SRAM cells' stability.

A dual Vt 7T (seven transistors) SRAM cell is presented in this work and compared to a standard 6T SRAM cell based on reading delay, writing delay, leakage power consumption, and Static Noise Margin (SNM) (during the hold, read and write). 

Reading and writing activities are performed on a single bit line in this proposed cell. As a result, the cell's access time is improved. Leakage power consumption is decreased by 61.50 per cent. The write latency has been decreased by 66.67%. On 65nm technology, at 27 C, all simulation work is done with Mentor Graphics' Eldo SPICE tool.
